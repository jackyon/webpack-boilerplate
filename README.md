<h5>JPEG:</h5>
```
fot now, I'm still using jpegmini, this is the best tools to compress the jpeg images that I discovered so far.
even though the jpegmini app is so simple to use it(just simple drag&drop), but I will consider to integrate this super tool into webpack. Still researching...
```


<h2>Hints:</h2>
why not using webpack imagein plugin, cause that plugin doesn't save so much sizes. if you have better solution plz contact me.

By default "npm run tinypng" will replace the original png files, there more usage:
```
tinypng [options] [image.png|*.png]
  -k, --api-key       Set default TinyPNG API key.
  -r, --allow-rewrite Rewrite the original files with compressed data.
  -n, --allow-nonpng  Allow you to compress files without .png extention.
  -p, --postfix       Postfix for compressed files when rewriting disabled.
  -h, --help          This message.
  -v, --version       Show version.
```
you can custom the scripts in package.json file.



<h2>The issues you might be focued.</h2>
<h3>Babel polyfill</h3>
the Babel polyfill wasn't included in the framework by default, feel free to follow this the article below if you want to use it.

<h3>errors when run 'npm run deploy'</h3>
In ubuntu system, when you try npm run deploy, it might be cause the errors, if you againest with this, try remove the FaviconsWebpackPlugin configs on webpack.config.js.
